                <h2>What is the California Stream Condition Index?</h2>
                <p>The California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) is a biological scoring tool that helps aquatic resource managers translate complex data about benthic macroinvertebrates found living in a stream into an overall measure of stream health. It is a measure of whether, and to what degree, the ecology of a stream is altered from a healthy state.</p>
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>Benthic macroinvertebrates are small invertebrates that live on stream bottoms. They are commonly used as indicators of water quality because they are sensitive to changes in their habitats and responsive to multiple stressors, such as sedimentation, nutrient enrichment, and riparian disturbance. Because benthic macroinvertebrates spend most of their lives in water, they can show the cumulative impacts of these stressors over time and space.</p>
                <p>The CSCI combines two separate indices: a multi-metric index that measures the ecological structure and function of a stream, and an observed-to-expected index that measures the taxonomic completeness of benthic macroinvertebrates found living in the same stream. Together, they offer multiple lines of evidence about the condition of the stream, providing greater confidence than a single index.</p>
                <p>The CSCI can be used to assess the status and trends of stream condition at multiple scales (sites, watersheds, regions, and statewide). It is well-suited for compliance monitoring and evaluating the success of mitigation and restoration projects, and stream protection policies and programs. It is also an integral component of the stateâ€™s <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/biostimulatory_substances_biointegrity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Biostimulatory Substances and Biological Integrity Provisions</a>.</p>
                <h2>How do I interpret the data?</h2>
                <p>In general, CSCI scores closer to 0 indicate a degradation of biological condition based on expected/predicted condition, and scores close to 1 or greater than 1 indicate healthy biological condition based on expected/predicted condition.</p>
