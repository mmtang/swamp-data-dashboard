                <h2>What is Boron?</h2>
                <p>Boron is a widely occurring element found in rocks, soil, and water. It does not exist in the environment as a pure element but is often combined with oxygen to form a group of compounds called borates. These compounds are widely used as whitening agents and in the manufacturing of many different commercial products, including fiberglass, ceramics, washing agents, and fire retardants. Other common boron compounds include boric acid, sodium borate (borax), and boron oxide.</p>
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>The natural borate content of surface water and groundwater is usually small, but it can increase due to natural processes and human activities. Natural processes include the leaching of rocks and soils that contain borate and borosilicate materials.  Human activities, such as agriculture and wastewater discharges, also contribute to the presence of boron in water.</p>
                <p>Boron is essential for the growth of plants, but at high concentrations it can be toxic to aquatic plants, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and birds. There are no Federal or statewide water quality standards for boron, but some Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards), including the Lahontan Regional Water Board and the San Diego Regional Water Board, have established water quality objectives for boron that apply to specific watersheds or locations within their regions. These objectives are outlined in each Regional Water Board's Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan).</p>
                <h2>How do I interpret the data?</h2>
                <p>There are no statewide water quality objectives for boron. A Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Water Board) may have region, waterbody, or site-specific water quality objectives for boron and other parameters. These objectives are outlined in each Regional Water Board's Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan).</p>
