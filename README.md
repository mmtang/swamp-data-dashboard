## About

***In active development***

A web application for viewing and downloading water quality data collected by the [Surface Water Ambient Montioring Program (SWAMP)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/). 

>The SWAMP mission is to provide resource managers, decision makers, and the public with timely, high-quality information to evaluate the condition of all waters throughout California. SWAMP accomplishes this through carefully designed, externally reviewed monitoring programs, and by assisting other entities state-wide in the generation of comparable data that can be brought together in integrated assessments that provide answers to current management questions.
